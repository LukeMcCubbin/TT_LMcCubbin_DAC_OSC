## How it works

Credit to Harald Pretl and Jakob Ratschenberger, Institute for Integrated Circuits, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria for the design of this circuit for TinyTapeout 5
Analog test (500kHz ring oscillator and 3-bit R-2R DAC) .

Nominal supply voltage: 1.8V

Two test outputs:

    Clock output (rail-rail) at ca. 500kHz
    DAC voltage vout=1.8V / 8 * in (0...7)


## How to test

Apply digital bit input to input bits 0-2 and measure output with voltmeter/osciloscope
